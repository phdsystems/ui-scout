# TODO: Runtime Analysis Capabilities

## Future Enhancements for Deep Runtime Understanding

1. **Execution Environment**: Run the application and observe behavior
2. **State Monitoring**: Track how user actions change application state  
3. **Flow Analysis**: Understand multi-step user journeys
4. **Error Pattern Detection**: Identify common failure scenarios
5. **Performance Profiling**: Analyze runtime performance characteristics

## Implementation Ideas

### Execution Environment
- Launch applications in headless browsers
- Instrument applications with monitoring hooks
- Capture network requests and responses
- Record DOM changes and user interactions

### State Monitoring  
- Track React/Vue state changes
- Monitor Redux/Vuex store updates
- Observe localStorage/sessionStorage changes
- Capture form validation states

### Flow Analysis
- Record complete user journeys
- Map navigation paths and decision points
- Identify critical user flows
- Generate end-to-end test scenarios

### Error Pattern Detection
- Monitor console errors and warnings
- Capture failed network requests
- Track unhandled promise rejections
- Identify accessibility violations

### Performance Profiling
- Measure page load times
- Track component render performance
- Monitor memory usage patterns
- Analyze bundle size impact
